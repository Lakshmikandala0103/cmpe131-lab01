Branches make teamwork way easier in coding. Everyone can work on their own part of the project without messing up the main code or each other’s progress. The main branch stays stable, while new features or fixes get built separately—so if something breaks, it doesn’t affect the whole thing. It also avoids the mess of one person’s code clashing with someone else’s. Before anything gets merged in, the team checks it over, runs tests, and makes sure it’s solid—so the main project stays clean and trouble-free.
